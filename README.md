### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [MaterializeInc/materialize](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize). That's where I spend most of my time and energy. Check it out!

- ðŸ’¬ My main interests are databases, database benchmarking, distributed systems, and [timely dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow).

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email or [twitter](https://twitter.com/narayanarjun).

- I maintain a [blog](https://ristret.com/arjun/) but I haven't blogged in a while, as I'm always behind on my professional writing obligations at [the Materialize blog](https://materialize.io/blog).
